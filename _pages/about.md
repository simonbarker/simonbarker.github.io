# About

This site is a collection of my projects and things that I've learned from programming in my spare time and for work. I am co-founder and technical director of a company called <a href="http://www.radfan.com">Radfan</a> based in the North East of England, I am a Chartered Engineer and spent far to long at university getting BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (graduating in 2008) and a PhD titled Resilient Energy Harvesting for Hostile Environments(graduating in 2011). 

I started programming during the first year of my PhD, initially starting with LabVIEW to get bits of lab equipment talking and automating the boring task of data collection. This soon escalated to a number of full test rigs including:

- a high temperature solar cell IV characterizer with full monochromatic spectrum analysis from room temperature to 350 &deg;C
- high temperature piezoelectric energy harvester characterization suite across the same temperature range with PID control for the vibration stage from 1 Hz to 1 kHz, 0.1 mg to 1 g of acceleration.

At the same time as building these rigs I took the online version of the Harvard course CS50. This was before it became the online sensation that it is now and required lots of (what felt at the time) complicated setup to get the code to compile with the CS50 supplied libraries - the year after I completed the course they released CS50 in a box which made life much easier and now it's all in an online IDE with automated problem set solution testing, it's a fantastic course and if you've not has a look I highly recommend it.

Since then I've:

- programmed PIC, ATMEL and ARM (mbed) micro-controllers in C
- learnt Squirrel to program [Electric Imps](https://electricimp.com)
- created a GUI in [Processing](http://processing.org) to control a 29 sensor room temperature analysis rig
- built a number of PHP based web applications including the finance manager that my wife and I have used for a number of years and [OneQstn.com](http://www.oneqstn.com)
- made my own Python stock management script 
- and then upgraded that to [Stock Controller app](http://www.stockcontrollerapp.com), written in Swift, available in the App Store.

I have made all three versions of my company's website and enjoy the design aspect as much as the underlying code development.

I spend most of my time out of work either in the gym, programming or mountain biking.
