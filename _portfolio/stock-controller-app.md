This is the application I use every day to run Radfan's production facility. When we launched the Radfan several years ago I managed production with Excel spreadsheets, as production levels grew I developed a more sophisticated management process using a Python script however I realized that going back to my computer all the time to enter data was not helpful. So I developed Stock Controller App and rather than making it Radfan specific I developed it so any factory manager can download and use it on this iOS device.

I created all of the branding, designs, mock ups, Core Data object model, integrated 4 frameworks through CocoaPods, the website at [StockControllerApp.com](http://www.stockcontrollerapp.com) and managed the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/stock-controller/id1132539298?mt=8">app store submission</a>.
